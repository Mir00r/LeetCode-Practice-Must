### Problem Link -> [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/)

Using a `HashSet` or sorting is also not desired, you can implement a **Two-pointer technique** or **Sliding window technique** with a sorted-like behavior using a **Balanced Binary Search Tree** (BST) data structure. In Java, the **`TreeSet`** can be utilized to provide this behavior with log(n) insert and search time complexity.


### Explanation:
1. **`TreeSet`** maintains the elements in a sorted order.
2. Inserting into the `TreeSet` takes \(O(\log n)\) time, and checking if the number already exists also takes \(O(\log n)\).
3. We iterate over the array once, checking for duplicates while adding each element to the `TreeSet`. If we find that the element already exists, we return `true`.
4. This approach does not involve sorting the array directly, but the `TreeSet` maintains the sorted property implicitly.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the array (due to `TreeSet` operations).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing the `TreeSet`.

### Alternative Explanation:
- This solution balances the trade-off between using additional space (like a HashSet) and maintaining a sorted-like property without directly sorting the array.

### Additional Optimized Solutions:

1. **Bucket Sort/Bloom Filter** (if the range of numbers is known):
   If the values in the array have a defined range, you can consider **bucket sort** or a **bloom filter** to track seen elements efficiently, but both require some additional space.

2. **Count Array**: If the array contains only positive integers and the range is well-defined and small, you can also use a **count array** to track occurrences.

However, in general scenarios where you're dealing with unsorted data and can't use additional sorting or HashSet approaches, **TreeSet** offers a balance between performance and simplicity.
