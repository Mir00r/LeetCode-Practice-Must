Let's break down the code you provided and analyze its **time complexity** and **space complexity**.

### Code Explanation 1:
The goal of this code is to find two numbers in the array `nums` that add up to the given `target`. It uses two pointers:
- `start`: Initialized to the first element of the array (index `0`).
- `end`: Initialized to the last element of the array (`nums.length - 1`).

The code iterates through the array, decreasing the `end` pointer on each iteration and checking if the sum of `nums[start] + nums[end]` is equal to the `target`. If the sum is equal to the target, it stores the indices in the `result` array and breaks out of the loop.

If `start == end` (meaning both pointers are at the same index), the `start` pointer is incremented by 1, and the `end` pointer is reset to the last index to continue the search from the next starting point.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- **Outer loop (while loop)**:
    - The outer loop runs as long as `start < end`. In the worst-case scenario, `start` needs to go through all the elements in the array.
    - Each time `end--` decreases `end`, and once `end` reaches the `start` index, the inner `if (start == end)` block increments `start` and resets `end` to `nums.length - 1`.
    - In essence, for every increment of `start`, the inner `end--` operation executes until `end` reaches `start`, making this resemble a double loop.

- **Worst-case scenario**:
    - For the first iteration of `start`, the `end` pointer goes from `n - 1` down to `1`, taking about `n` operations.
    - For the second iteration of `start`, the `end` pointer again goes from `n - 1` down to `2`, taking about `n - 1` operations.
    - This pattern continues until `start` reaches the end of the array.

  Therefore, the time complexity of this approach is roughly:
  \[
  O(n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + \ldots + 1) = O\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right) = O(n^2)
  \]
  So, the **time complexity is O(n²)**.

### Space Complexity Analysis:
- **Space for input and variables**:
    - The array `nums` itself takes up **O(n)** space.
    - The `result` array of size 2 takes **O(1)** space.
    - The variables `start`, `end`, and `target` also take up **O(1)** space.

- **No additional data structures are used**, and the function only modifies the input array in place.

Thus, the **space complexity is O(1)**, excluding the space taken by the input array.

### Summary:
- **Time complexity**: **O(n²)** in the worst case, since for each increment of `start`, the `end` pointer traverses the remaining elements.
- **Space complexity**: **O(1)** (not considering the input array).


Yes, there's a more efficient solution using a **hash map** to solve this problem, typically referred to as the **two-sum problem**. The hash map approach reduces the time complexity to **O(n)**, which is more optimal than the solution you're using that has a complexity closer to **O(n²)** due to the double iteration (as you're decreasing `end` in each iteration and resetting it).

### Optimized Hash Map Approach:
The idea here is to traverse the array once, and for each number, check if its complement (i.e., `target - current_number`) exists in the hash map. If it does, we have found the solution. If not, we store the current number in the hash map so that we can refer to it later as a potential complement for future elements.

### Explanation:
1. **Hash Map Storage**: The map stores the numbers as keys and their indices as values.
2. **Complement Check**: For each number, we compute its complement (i.e., `target - current_number`). If the complement is already in the hash map, it means that the current number and the complement add up to the target.
3. **Single Pass**: This solution works in **O(n)** time complexity, as each element is processed at most once.

### Key Points:
- This solution is **efficient** with time complexity **O(n)** and space complexity **O(n)** due to the hash map.
- The method returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
